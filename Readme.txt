INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================

--------------------------------------------------
Controls:

|    Action    |           Keys           |
  move left      A or left arrow
  move right     D or right arrow
  fire           Space or left mouse click

--------------------------------------------------
Display: 

your character's hit box is represented as a white
box overlaid on the sprite, this is so you can 
easily keep track of it to dodge bullets, you can
turn it off by setting the global bool HIT_BOX to
false, this will use your sprites bounding box as
the hit box

Your kill count for the current level is displayed
in the upper left, the current level number is 
displayed in the upper middle, and your current
lives are displayed in the upper right

--------------------------------------------------
Features:

Press ESC to pause while in game

By default there are 6 levels, some of the levels
are pretty hard though, so for testing the winning
screen, etc. I've included a global bool in main
ALL_LEVELS which if set to false will make the
program not add the last 4 levels to the game
